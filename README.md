# Business-Analysis-of-Hospital-Management-System-for-Mayo-Clinic
Challenge:
The clinic lacked a centralized system for managing workflows, stakeholder roles, and data integration across departments.
      Action:
Applied the Business Analysis Core Concept Model (BACCM) to define scope and stakeholder needs. Developed a RACI matrix, conducted process mapping, classified requirements, and designed mock-up screens and ERD models for the database structure.
      Result:
Delivered a comprehensive business analysis framework that served as a blueprint for developing a centralized, efficient hospital management system prototype, improving clarity in stakeholder roles and future system design.
